# TRIQS Docker Image

This builds the [flatironinstitute/triqs](https://hub.docker.com/r/flatironinstitute/triqs) docker hub images which include triqs and applications.

It can be used to run a Jupyter notebook environment yourself or on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/TRIQS/docker/unstable), or to run a shell for development.
